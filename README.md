# Static Distributed Text Services (DTS) Generator

The principle is the same as a static web site generator but for Distributed Text Services. This server-side javascript app requests documents from a DTS server such as kdl-dts-server and saves the responses to the file system. The response files can be served by a static web server (e.g. Github pages) and consumed by a DTS client with some minor adaptations of the client code.
